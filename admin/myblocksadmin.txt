- myblocksadmin -


SUMMARY:

This files add blocks admin into your module.


BACKGROUND:

XOOPS's admin of blocks and groups will be hard to use,
when many modules is installed.
If each module has the block management screen for itself,
webmasters using XOOPS will feel it easy, I think.
I will recommend it to the module developers by all means.


HOW TO USE:

1) copy 5 files of
     myblocksadmin.php
     myblockform.php
     mygroupperm.php
     mygrouppermform.php
     admin.php
   into modules/(your module)/admin/
   (this admin.php is compatible for mymenu)

2) copy 3 file of
     blocksadmin.inc.php
     gtickets.php
     updateblock.inc.php (optional)
   into modules/(your module)/include
   (this gtickets.php is compatible for mymenu)

3) edit admin/menu.php and append a menu item like this:

    $adminmenu[] = array( 'title' => _MI_SYSTEM_ADMENU2 ,
                          'link' => "admin/myblocksadmin.php" ) ;

4) If you want to add a feature keeping block's options when module is updated:

     append this code into the tale of your xoops_version.php

[code]
// On Update
if( ! empty( $_POST['fct'] ) && ! empty( $_POST['op'] ) && $_POST['fct'] == 'modulesadmin' && $_POST['op'] == 'update_ok' && $_POST['dirname'] == $modversion['dirname'] ) {
    include dirname( __FILE__ ) . "/include/onupdate.inc.php" ;
}
[/code]

     copy onupdate.inc.php.sample in this archive to modules/(your module)/include/onupdate.inc.php
     edit onupdate.inc.php as you like.


5) If you want to modify a block cloneable, insert a line into xoops_version.php

[code]
$modversion['blocks'][(block_number)]['can_clone'] = true ;
[/code]



That's all !

Found a small typo in WF-Links 1.07 that causes new links not to be displayed correctly on the Index Page.
To fix this open the file ../templates/wflinks_index.html and find this line:
Code:
<{include file="db:wflinks_linkload.html" link=$link[i]}>

Replace the above line with the following:
Code:
<{include file="db:wflinks_linkload.html" wfllink=$link[i]}>

Save the file, upload it to your server and update WF-Links from the Module Administration.
